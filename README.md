# Number-Writing-Manipulator-usingRobotoics-toolbox-and-MATLAB-
A Number  Writing Manipulator done using Robotics toolbox and MATLAB 

In this problem, we can see the working of a 3 -number writing planar robotic 
manipulator in MATLAB with a graphical interface. We can build the number 
writing manipulator using any degree of freedom. Inverse kinematics is used by 
the manipulator to draw the number. When the user runs the code, he will be 
shown the list of numbers the manipulator can draw. The list of numbers includes 
(1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 0). So, when the user chooses a particular number from the list, the 
robotic manipulator will draw that number in a graphical plot.
